                    <h1>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h1>
                    <p>Set in 1940 during the second World War, the 4 Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy - are evacuated from London and sent to live in a large house in the country with Professor Digory Kirke.</p>

                    <p>Whilst exploring the house, Lucy finds her way into a large wardrobe which in turn leads her to the magical world of Narnia where she initially meets a faun called Mr Tumnus who tells Lucy he was going to report her to The White Witch, the false ruler of Narnia who had kept it in perpetual winter.</p>

                    <p>Instead Mr Tumnus guides Lucy back home where Lucy shares her unbelievable story with her siblings who all think she is talking nonsense.</p>

                    <p>Although not convinced, Edmund humours Lucy and follows her into the wardrobe and finds himself in a different part of Naria than Lucy described and he soon meets the White Witch.</p>

                    <p>The White Witch wants to know more about Edmund and his siblings so she proceeds to offer him his favourite sweet - Turkish Delight - however this magic infused version is tastier than anything Edmund has tasted before.</p>

                    <p>Edmund tells the White Witch everything she wants to know and also tells her about Mr Tumnus. For his information he is promised the gift of becoming a Prince in Narnia.</p>

                    <p>The next visit to Narnia is made by all 4 children where they quickly learn that Tumnus has been arrested for treason, and they meet Mr & Mrs Beaver who tell them of a prophecy that claims the White Witches rule will end when <i><b>"the 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve"</b></i>sit on the Four Thrones of Car Paravel and that Narnia's true ruler, the lion Aslan, is returning after years of absence.</p>

                    <p>Edmund betrays his family again by sneaking back to the White Witch and telling her of Aslans return, and the White Witch orders the deaths of Edmunds siblings and the Beavers.</p>

                    <p>The White Witch and Aslan make an arrangement whereby she will spare Edmund, however Aslan must lay down his life in order to do so, to which Aslan agrees.</p>

                    <p>Aslan is duly put to death by the White Witch, however, the following morning, having invoked "Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time", Aslan is brought back to life.</p>

                    <p>Aslans army is still at battle with the Witch's army, however they prevail and Aslan kills the White Witch, after which the 4 children are crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.</p>

                    <p>After a long rein the children, now adults, hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant wishes to whomever catches it. They arrive at the lamp-post which marks the entrance to Narnia and unintentionally pass through the wardrobe and back into the country house in England.</p>

                    <p>They are still the children they were and no time seems to have passed here, unlike within Narnia. They explain their story to Professor Kirke who believes them and assures them they will one day return to Narnia.</p>
