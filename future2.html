                    <h1>Back to the Future Part II</h1>
                    <p>On Saturday October 26th 1985, Dr Emmett "Doc" Brown arrives unexpectedly in a DeLorean time machine and persuades Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer, to travel to the year 2015 with him to help their future children.</p>

                    <p>Arriving on Wednesday October 21st 2015, Doc electronically incapcitates Jennifer explaining she shouldn't know too much about her future. Doc then gives Marty clothes to change into so he fits in with everyone else, then Doc and Marty hide the sleeping Jennifer in an alleyway for a few minutes.</p>

                    <p>Doc shows Marty a newspaper with a story about how Marty Jr. (his future son) is arrested, tried and convicted to 15 years in jail for a botched robbery, all within 2 hours of his arrest and Doc tells him that next week his daughter attempts to break him out, gets caught and gets 20 years in jail. Marty sees the date on the newspaper is tomorrows and Doc explains that is why he brought him to the future.</p>

                    <p>Whilst in town, Marty passes an antique shop and sees a sports almanac with results of major sporting events from 1950-2000 then heads into local diner, Cafe 80's, where he is spotted by Biff, the town bully when Marty's dad was young, and who picked on Marty's dad relentlessly throughout high school.</p>
                        
                    <p>Marty has a fight with Griff, Biffs grandson, when he sees his future son being bullied. After beating Griff he makes his escape on a hoverboard, chased by Griffs gang. After escaping the gang he goes back and buys the sport almanac. Doc finds it and gives Marty a row for trying to profit from the future and places the almanac in the trash, but Biff sees them. They are interrupted by the police who have found Jennifer and are taking her to her 2015 home.</p>

                    <p>Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and realises she is in the future. She hears someone moving around upstairs just before the door bell goes and she decides to hide in a closet in the living room. Whilst hiding in the closet she sees her future daughter come downstais and answer the door to her grandparents (1985 Marty's mom & dad) who have brought dinner with them.</p>

                    <p>Still hiding in the closet, Jennifer overhears that her future self's life with Marty is not what she expected due to his involvement in a car accident. As she is listening in on the conversation her future son passes her in the hallway and says 'nice pants, mom' which throws her for a loop.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moments later, the 2015 version of Marty comes home from work and speaks to their son who is watching TV, before making his way into the kitchen as his mom is putting a Pizza Hut dehydrated pizza into the Black & Decker Rehydrator which changes it from a 4" pizza to a 14" pizza in 2 seconds.</p>  
                    
                    <p>Jennifer overhears another conversation where her future husband Marty is fired from his job and she tries to escape the house, however she meets her 2015 self as she's leaving the front door and faints. As Marty and Doc attend to her, Biff steals the time machine to travel back in time and give the almanac to his younger self, then returns to 2015. Marty, Doc, and an unconscious Jennifer return to 1985, unaware of Biff's actions.</p>

                    <p>The 1985 they return to has changed dramatically, with Biff now one of the country's wealthiest and most corrupt men. He has turned Hill Valley into a chaotic dystopia, secretly killed Marty's father, George, in 1973, and forced Marty's mother, Lorraine, to marry him, and Doc is in a mental hospital.</p>

                    <p>Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, carefully avoiding interrupting the events from his previous visit. After several fruitless attempts, Marty finally gets the almanac and burns it to undo the changes to the past.</p>

                    <p>Doc is hovering nearby in the DeLoren when it is suddenly struck by lightening casuing it to disappear, only for  Western Union rider to immediately appear in its place with a letter for Marty.
                       Marty sees the letter is from Doc telling him that he has been transported back in time to the year 1885. Marty then races into town to find the 1955 version of Doc who had just helped Marty to return to 1985. Shocked by Marty's sudden reappearance, Doc faints.</p>
