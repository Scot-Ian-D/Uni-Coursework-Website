                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">IMDB: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>

                    <p>Year Released: 2005</p>

                    <p>Based On: C. S. Lewis novel of the same name</p>

                    <p>Starring: Tilda Swinton, Georgie Henley, James McAvoy</p>

                    <p>Studio: Walt Disney Productions</p>

                    <p>Quotes: "Don't cite Deep Magic to me, witch! I was there when it was written!", "For Narnia and for Aslan!", "Winter is nearly over."</p>

                    <p>About the Turkish Delight: Symbolizes temptation and sin. When Edmund is found by the White Witch, she offers him his favourite treat of Turkish Delight.</p>   
                    
                    <p>The Turkish Delight is enchanted and Edmund is so desperate to eat more he bends to the White Witches will and betrays his family.</p>

                    <p>Trivia: The wolves that destroyed the Beavers' home were mostly real animals, with one or two CGI ones added in, although their tails had to be digitally removed and re-added. Their tails kept wagging while filming the scene, making them appear friendly.</p>

                    <p>The inscription on the blade of Peter's sword reads, "When Aslan shakes his mane, Narnia shall know spring again."</p>

                    <p>Aslan is a Turkish word meaning Lion. Lewis came up with the name during a trip to Turkey before 1922, where he saw the Sultan's elite guards, called Aslan because of their bravery and loyalty.</p>

                    <p>Although C.S. Lewis wrote "The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" first, it is actually chronologically the second book of "The Chronicles of Narnia." The first book chronologically is "The Magician's Nephew."</p>
