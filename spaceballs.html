                    <h1>Spaceballs</h1>
                    <p>A paraody of Star Wars, Spaceballs tells the story of the planet Spaceball, lead by the incompetent President Skroob, which has squandered its supply of fresh air and is now looking to steal that of Planet Druidia.</p>
                
                    <p>President Skroob enlists the help of the evil Dark Helmet to help force Druidia give up the code to the planetery force field that protects their fresh air by kidnapping Princess Vespa, the daughter of King Roland, the leader of Druidia.</p>

                    <p>In response to the threat, King Roland calls upon the help of Lone Starr and his half-man half-dog companion, Barf and offers a massive reward for saving Vespa. As Lone Starr is in debt to interplanetary mobster Pizza The Hut, he agrees, planning to use the money he makes to settle his debt.</p>

                    <p>In what looks to be an easy mission, Lone Starr and Barf reach Vespa before Spaceballs and resuce her, however their ship runs out of fuel and they have to crash land on a nearby desert moon of the planet Vega. Having no choice, they attempt to make their way through the desert on foot, but soon pass out in the blazing heat of the sun.</p>
               
                    <p>The group are found by people known as Dinks and are taken to a cave to meet Yogurt who teaches Lone Starr about a metaphysical power known as 'The Schwartz'.</p>

                    <p>In order to locate Vespa, Dark Helmet breaks the 4th wall by fast forwarding a VHS copy of Spaceballs, sees they are on the moon of Vega and travels there to capture Vespa.</p>
                
                    <p>Once on the moon, Dark Helmet tricks Vespa into showing herself by pretending to be King Roland and captures her. Once back on planet Spaceball he threatens to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing King Roland to give up the code to his planets shield, thus allowing Spaceballs to steal their air.</p>
                
                    <p>Spaceballs deploy 'Mega-Maid' - a Statue of Liberty like huge robot with a hoover which sucks all of the air off of planet Druidia. Lone Starr uses the power of The Schwartz to reverse the switch from 'suck' to 'blow' on the hoover and returns all the air to Druidia, saving its people.</p>
                
                    <p>Lone Starr and Dark Helmet end up battling inside Mega-Maid and Lone Starr loses his Schwartz ring and, whilst unarmed, Yogurt speaks to  him to tell him that the Schwartz is in him, not the ring.</p>

                    <p> Yogurts words resonate with Lone Starr and he defeats Dark Helmet, causing him to press against the comically over-sized self destruct button within Mega-Maid.</p>
                
                    <p>With Lone Starr's debt to Pizza the Hutt nullified due to the gangsters untimely demise he returns Vespa to King Roland, taking only enough reward money to cover his expenses. He then receives an unexpected message from Yogurt making him aware that he is actually a prince and thus he can marry Vespa.ยง</p>
