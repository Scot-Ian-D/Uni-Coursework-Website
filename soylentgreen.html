                    <h1>Soylent Green</h1>
                    <p>The 1973 dystopian classic, Soylent Green, paints a bleak and forboding picture of the year 2022, where world populations have soared, the majority of people live in abject poverty and only a few 'super elites' can afford a place to live, clean water and ample food supplies.</p>
                
                    <p>Those who are fortunate enough to fall into the 'elite' category reside in grandiose buildings which are heavily fortified and have tenenets who are their personal bodyguards.</p>

                    <p>Those less fortunate have to harvest water from whatever sources they can and, with no access to fresh food, must survive on a high processed wafer type food known as Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow and, by far the that most flavoursome and nutrient dense: Soylent Green.</p>

                    <p>The lead protagonist of the story is an NYPD cop known as Robert Thorn and he shares a place with his friend Sol Roth, a retired college professor and police analyst.</p>

                    <p>Whilst Robert is investigating the high profile murder of a member of the Soylent Corporations board he becomes aware that all is not what it seems within the Soylent Corporation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Roth continues to reaseach the case for Robert and uses 2 volumes of a book titled <i>Soylent Oceanographic Survery Report 2015-2019</i> in which Robert discovers that the worlds oceans are dying and there is insufficient plankton remaining to continue production of Soylent Green.</p>

                    <p>Roth discerns that the murdered Soylent Corporation board member had been killed by an assassin who was hired by the rest of the board as they were concerned that he would reveal the truth behind the business.</p>

                    <p>Roth is so torn up by what he learns he plans to commit suicide at a Government assissted suicide clinic, however Thorn tries in vain to stop him carrying out the process.</p>

                    <p>Before Roth dies he tells Thorn all he has learnt which motivates Thorn into uncovering proof of the crimes committed by Soylent Corporation so the board can be rightly tried.</p>

                    <p>Thorn secretly boards a waste vehicle which is transporting the bodies of the dead from the assissted suidicde clinics to the Soylent Corporation and he witnesses the corpses being turned into Soylent Green wafers.</p>

                    <p>The Soylent Corporation attempt to silence Thorn by sending men after him, however he kills them all and, whilst received medical attention urges the truth be told to the masses by screaming: <b><i>"Soylent Green is people!"</i></b></p>
