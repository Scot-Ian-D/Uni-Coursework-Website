                    <h1>Alice in Wonderland</h1>
                    <p>The tale begins with a young girl, Alice, being taught history in a park in England by her older sister during which she begins to daydream.</p>

                    <p>As Alice daydreams she spots a white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and pocketwatch complaining of being late running around the park and decides to follow it.</p>

                    <p>The white rabbit goes into a burrow and Alice follows causing her to fall deep into the rabbit hole, finally landing in a weird and magical place known as Wonderland.</p>
                    
                    <p>Alice finds herself in front of a tiny door whose talking door handle advises she drink from the bottle on the table nearby. Doing so causes Alice to unexpectedly shrink to the appropriate size to fit through the door.</p>

                    <p>As Alice tries to open the door she realises she doesn't have a key and finds it is on the table which is now towering above her. She is then told to eat a magic cookie which will make her grown tall enough to reach the table and retrieve the key. Once she has the key she drinks from the bottle once again and shrinks to a size to fit through the door.</p>

                    <p>Once on the other side, Alice sees the white rabbit and follows him to his house. The rabbit mistakes her for his housemaid and sends Alice inside to fetch his gloves. Once inside the rabbits house Alice sees and eats another cookie, causing her to grow so big she fills the house and gets stuck.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The rabbit wants Alice out of his house so tells a nearby Dodo and together they decide the only course of action is to burn down the house. Alice panics at the thought of this and manages to grab and eat a carrot from the rabbits garden which causes her to shrink down to only 3 inches tall and make good her escape.</p>

                    <p>Next Alice meets a smoking catepillar who advises her to eat from different sides of the mushrooms in Wonderland to alter her size when needed. Alice finally works out how to be her 'normal' size, and keeps spare pieces of mushroom on her in case they are needed.</p>

                    <p>Later Alice finds herself in some woods and meets the Cheshire Cat who suggests she ask the Mad Hatter or the March Hare where the white rabbit is, but is not helpful in telling Alice which path through the woods she should take. Indigent, Alice takes her own path and stumbles across both, with their friend Dormouse, celebrating an 'unbirthday' with a tea party.</p>
                
                    <p>The trio ask what Alice's prediciment is, and, as she tries to explain, she is continually interuppted by their absurd logic and silly goings on to the point where, exasperated, Alice decides to leave and continue her journey.</p>

                    <p>The Cheshire Cat re-appears and offers to lead Alice to the Queen of Hearts, the only person in Wonderland who can lead Alice back home again. On meeting the Queen, Alice is invited to play croquet where live flamingos and hedgehogs are used as the croquet equipment and who rig the game in favour of the Queen to ensure that she wins.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Cheshire Cat, being mischievous, decides to play a trick on the Queen, however sets it up so that Alice takes the blame. The Queen is furious and orders her decapitation.</p>

                    <p>Alice takes a piece of mushroom from her pocket, eats it, and grows large which indimidates the court of the Queen. The effects are short lived and soon Alice is her normal size again and she runs away with a crowd in pursuit of her.</p>
                
                    <p>Finally Alice reaches the small door she entered Wonderland through and, peering through the keyhole, she can see herself asleep on the other side, at which point Alice wakes up and returns home with her sister for tea.</p>
