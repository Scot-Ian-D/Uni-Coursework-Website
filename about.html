                    <h1>Welcome to me.</h1>
                    <p>Ian. Cyber security hack. Whisky aficinado. All round good egg.</p>

                    <p>A 'mid-life crisis' at 38 made me realise that my job in Governance / Risk for a global alcoholic beverage manufacturer wasn't the life for me.</p>

                    <p>Having had a life long interest in computers (1994 is when I was first shown how to build a desktop from parts, and had my first foray online using a 9600 baud modem using Netspace Navigator), I decided to throw myself into the deep end with Cyber security</p>

                    <p>Currently work as a Cyber Security Analyst for a global accountancy / training company.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time I like to tinker with CTF Red Team sites, read, walk the dog, kick it with the kids, and I am an avid lover of all genres of movies and music.</p>
