                    <p>Year Released: 1973</p>

                    <p>Based On: 1966 novel 'Mark Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison</p>

                    <p>Starring: Charlton Heston, Edward G. Robinson, Leigh Taylor-Young</p>

                    <p>Studio: MGM</p>

                    <p>Quotes: "There's nothing I can do for you furniture - I got nothing to give", "Soylent Green is people!", "How did we come to this?"</p>

                    <p>About Soylent Green wafers: Soylent Green has no set symbolism, in fact the novel it was based off of did not have the cannibalism element included, instead it focsed more on over population of the planet and the detrimental impact that brought.</p>

                    <p>MGM had decided that over population alone wasn't very sexy, so adding in the 'twist' about eat people spiced it up somewhat.</p>

                    <p>Trivia: The Soylent Green manufacturing facility is the Chevron oil refinery and power plant in El Segundo, California.</p>

                    <p>In the novel, the word "soylent" is supposed to suggest soybeans and lentils.</p>

                    <p>Final film of Edward G. Robinson. He filmed the movie whilst keeping his terminal cancer diagnosis quite quiet and died before the movie was released.</p>

                    <p>Leigh Taylor-Young (Shirl) and Stephen Young (Gilbert) were the only stars of the film who lived to see the real 2022.</p>
