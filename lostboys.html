                    <h1>The Lost Boys</h1>
                    <p>Michael and Sam Emerson move with their mom, Lucy, to the small beach town of Santa Carla, California to live with Lucy's parents after her divorce, and Lucy secures work in a local video store run by Max Lawrence.</p>

                    <p>Michael quickly becomes infatuated by a girl called Star, however he quickly learns she is the girlfriend of the leader of the local biker gang, David Powers.</p>

                    <p>Sam finds himeself in the local comic book store where he meets Edgar and Alan Frog who tell him they are vampire hunters and who go on to tell Sam about the 'undead' threat that they claim has infiltrated Santa Carla.</p>

                    <p>Michael, still infatuated by Star, ends up being challenged to several tests of courage by David and his biker gang before finally being extended the opportunity to pass initiation and join the gang himself.</p>

                    <p>One night, during a meal at the biker gangs hangout, Michael is eating rice from a Chinese takeout when David asks him how his maggots taste. Looking down into the carton Michael sees it is full of maggots and proceeds to spit out his food, only for it to land on the floor as rice.</p>

                    <p>By way of apology, David then offers Michael his food - noodles - however when he goes to take them its full of earthworms and he refuses - David then takes a mouthful and Michael can see that it is only noodles he is eating.</p>
                        
                    <p>David then asks for wine to be brought to him and he opens the bottle and takes a drink and Michael is offered the bottle with David telling him to "take a drink and become one of us". Star attempts to tell him not to drink it as it is blood, however Michael disgregards the warning and drinks it anyway, much to the delight of the rest of the gang.</p>

                    <p>Michael then starts noticing changes: his eyes become sensitive to sunlight, the smell of food turns his stomach, his reflection becomes noticably transparent, and he develops a lust for blood.</p>

                    <p>Michael's lust for blood leads him to attack his brother, Sam, but he is stopped in time by Sam's dog. Sam figures out that as Michael has no yet killed a human he is a "half-vampire" and can be turned back to human if they can kill the head vampire.</p>

                    <p>Sam and the Frog brothers think that Max is the head vampire, but they notice that he has a reflection when he is in Michael and Sam's house for a date with Lucy.</p>

                    <p>David tries to entice Michael into carrying out his first kill but he keep refusing, and Star reveals to Michael that her and another gang member, Laddie, are both half-vampire too.</p>

                    <p>Michael takes Sam and the brothers Frog to the vampires lair during the day with a plan to kill them all. They stake the first vampire which wakes the rest of the gang. Realising that they can't win, and that the vampire gang will come for them that night, they retreat and lock themselves in Lucy's house, armed with holy water, a longbow and stakes.</p>

                    <p>As expected the vampires attack the house that night during which 2 of the vampires are killed by Sam and the Frog's whilst David and Michael battle it out.</p>

                    <p>David becomes impaled but there is no change to Star, Laddie or Michael meaning he is not the head vampire after all. Lucy and Max later return to the house after a date and Max confirms <b>he</b>is infact the head vampire and accounts for his earlier reflection due to the fact he was invited into the house.</p>

                    <p>Max reveals his plan was to have both Michel and Sam turned into vampires to force Lucy into becoming one too so she would be the mother to his 'lost boys'. Max then pulls Lucy close to him so he can transform her when Grandpa crashes through the side of the house in his jeep and impales Max on a fence post causing him to explode.</p>

                    <p>Michael, Star and laddie return to normal and their nightmare is over.</p>
