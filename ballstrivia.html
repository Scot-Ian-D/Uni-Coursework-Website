                    <p>The box for Spaceballs: The Breakfast Cereal says it contains "100% sugar".</p>

                    <p>Mel Brooks tried to get either Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks for the role of Captain Lone Starr.</p>

                    <p>The bumper sticker on the back of Lone Starr's Winnebago spaceship reads: I [heart] URANUS.</p>
