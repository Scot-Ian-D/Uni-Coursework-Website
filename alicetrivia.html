                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043274/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">IMDB: Alice in Wonderland</a>

                    <p>Year Released: 1951</p>

                    <p>Based On: Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'</p>

                    <p>Starring: Kathryn Beaumont, Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway</p>

                    <p>Studio: Walt Disney Productions</p>

                    <p>Quotes: "Curiouser and curiosuer", "There's no time in my watch, no time!", "In my world, the books would be nothing but pictures"</p>

                    <p>About the Cookies: The Eat Me Cookies are magical and cause anyone who eats them to grow to a giant size.</p>
                    
                    <p>They first appear right near Alice in a box by the Doorknob so she could try one of them to grow to reach the key on the table (also summoned by the Doorknob). More are seen in the White Rabbit's House, where Alice finds them in a bowl and innocently took a bite out of one, then grew giant-sized again.</p>
                
                    <p>Trivia: This movie is a combination of Lewis Carroll's two "Alice" books, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass."</p>

                    <p>The Mad Hatter was drawn to resemble his voice actor Ed Wynn.</p>

                    <p>The Doorknob was the only character in the film that did not appear in Lewis Carroll's books.</p>

                    <p>Kathryn Beaumont, who was the voice of Alice, narrates the "Alice in Wonderland" ride at Disneyland.</p>
