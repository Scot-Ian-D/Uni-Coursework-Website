                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">IMDB: The Lost Boys</a>

                    <p>Year Released: 1987</p>

                    <p>Based On: Original screenplay (however the title was a reference to The Lost Boys in J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan & Neverland, as they too never grow up)</p>

                    <p>Starring: Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim, Jason Patric</p>

                    <p>Studio: Warner Bros</p>

                    <p>Quotes: "Death by stereo", "Come on, be one of us", "Initiations over, Michael. Time to join the club!"</p>

                    <p>Maggot Rice: Vampire lore depicts them having the ability to use magick and have the ability to control a human mind. At the juncture in the story where Micahel sees the maggots he is not yet turned and the vampires are toying with him in their lair.</p>

                    <p>Michael still doesn't believe that vampires are real and is unaware that they are effectively grooming him to become one. Even after being shown the maggot rice (and the worm noodles) he is still oblivious to what is going on.</p>

                    <p>Trivia: Filming began on June 2, 1986 and ended on June 23, 1986 after only 21 days.</p>

                    <p>According to the writers, the character name of Lucy was chosen to reflect with Lucy Westernra from Bram Stoker's Dracula.</p>

                    <p>The names of the Frog brothers, Edgar and Alan, are a reference to Edgar Allan Poe, the well-known writer of horror fiction.</p>

                    <p>When they're eating Chinese food, David leaves his chopsticks sticking straight out of his and Michael's food. In Chinese and Japanese culture, it is offensive to give a meal with chopsticks sticking into it, because it is like wishing death upon the recipient.</p>
